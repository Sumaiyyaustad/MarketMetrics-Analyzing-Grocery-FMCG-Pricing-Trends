# 📊 MarketMetrics – Analyzing Grocery & FMCG Pricing Trends

 ## 📝 Overview  
MarketMetrics is an end-to-end data analytics project aimed at uncovering pricing patterns, brand distribution, and discount dynamics in the online grocery and FMCG sector using SQL and Python. The analysis was performed on a real-world dataset from BigBasket with over 28,000 products. The goal was to derive actionable business insights through queries, statistical exploration, and ranking using window functions.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning  
Performed using Pandas and SQL:  
- Removed duplicates and null values  
- Standardized category and brand names  
- Converted price columns to numerical types  
- Verified rating consistency and missing product metadata  

## 🧠 SQL Analysis  
We used MySQL for all queries and window functions.

Key Insights Extracted:
• Average sale price per category  
• Products priced above category average  
• Products with discounts >30%  
• Most expensive item in each category  
• Products with rating >4.5  
• Top 5 premium products in each category using ROW_NUMBER  
• Running average prices and price percentiles for smarter tiering  
• Product counts by brand to determine market dominance  

## 🧠 Insights (from Jupyter Notebook Analysis)

✔️ **Category Pricing Behavior**  
- Categories like **packaged food** and **personal care** show a wide range in pricing.  
- After capping outliers using IQR methods, price comparisons became more stable.  

✔️ **Brand Strategy Observations**  
- Budget brands have **narrow and consistent pricing**, while premium brands show **wider price spreads**.  
- Even top-performing brands have **outlier products**, often premium or import items.  

✔️ **Brand Dominance by Category**  
- Specific brands are category leaders, dominating segments like **beverages** or **hygiene**.  
- Useful for prioritizing **category-level promotions** and **supply chain focus**.

## 📌 Key Features  
✔️ SQL and Python-based insights and trend detection  
✔️ Use of window functions (`ROW_NUMBER()`, `AVG() OVER`, `PERCENT_RANK()`)  
✔️ Detailed project report with team insights and recommendations  
✔️ Real-world retail dataset covering 28K products  
✔️ Tiered strategy recommendation using product price segments
